A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in style f or e (or in style F or E in the case of a G conversion specifier), depending on the value converted and the precision. Let P equal the precision if nonzero, 6 if the precision is omitted, or 1 if the precision is zero. Then, if a conversion with style E would have an exponent of X:

    if P > X ≥ −4, the conversion is with style f (or F) and precision P − (X + 1).
    otherwise, the conversion is with style e (or E) and precision P − 1.

Finally, unless the # flag is used, any trailing zeros are removed from the fractional portion of the result and the decimal-point character is removed if there is no fractional portion remaining.

A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style of an f or F conversion specifier.
